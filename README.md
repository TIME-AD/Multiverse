# Practical coding to address the reproducibility crisis SER Workshop 2025:
This code will be used in Society for Epidemiologic Resarch [workshop](https://epiresearch.org/annual-meeting/2025-meeting/2025-workshops/) entitled "Practical coding to address the reproducibility crisis". 

While replication of results is an essential component of the scientific method, recent work has shown that many findings can not be reproduced. In this context, approaches allowing for rigorous evaluation of how analytic decisions affect estimates are needed. Proposed approaches (e.g. multiverse analyses, multidimensional sensitivity analyses, and simulations sampling from a parameter space) require specifying and iterating over hundreds or thousands of analysis options, models, or datasets. However, little guidance has been provided for how to write and organize code to efficiently iterate over large numbers of specifications. 

Using multiverse analysis to investigate how different specifications of eligibility criteria, exposure definition, and covariate sets affect estimates in an applied example in BRFSS, we will provide a framework and example R code for conducting and visualizing analyses where the researcher would like to iterate over many analysis specifications. 

Building on R fundamentals, participants will write efficient code to iterate over analytic decisions, yielding organized results. After this workshop, participants will better understand intermediate coding concepts (parallel computing, functions, and loops), efficiently structure code, and successfully complete a multiverse analysis from start (design) to finish (visualization). These skills will improve reproducibility of code and understanding of how analytic decisions impact scientific conclusions.
